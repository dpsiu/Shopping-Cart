# Shopping Cart

This project is a mock shopping cart application built using React. It demonstrates various concepts such as component structure, routing, state management, and interaction with APIs. The project demo includes a home page, a shop page with a shopping cart, and individual product cards with interactive features and is hosted with Netlify.

## Why I built the project this way
- The project design comes bare bones with a minimalistic design. The idea was to deliver a project that adheres to certain modern design principles without going overboard where not needed. This allows more focus on the application logic and utilization of React's core concepts such as state management, interaction with APIs, routing, and React's hooks.

## Features
- Three pages: Home, Shop, and Checkout page.
- Navigation bar to switch between pages.
- Display the number of items in the cart on the navigation bar.
- Individual card elements for each product.
- Increment and decrement buttons for fine-tuning quantity.
- Fetching shop items from an API (e.g., Mock Shop API).

## Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS
- React
- React Router DOM
- Fetching Data (MockShop API integration)
- State Management
- Component Structure

## With more time, I would...
- Create a curated mobile UX
- Create a light/Dark mode
- Implement a Filter feature to search by categories such as "tops, bottoms, accessories" etc.
